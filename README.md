# MyReads Project

This was my first project I did when I enrolled in the udacity React course, the idea of this application is to add books in to a user book shelf and the shelf has 3 sections(Want to read, Currently reading, Read), the user can also explore new books and add new books to the shelf when he wants using the explore page. 

## How To start

* Download the project and export the files
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Backend Server

All Books are fecthed using a BookAPI that was given by Udacity to make the development easier and ready to start coding the app.
